# **CapEx Driver-Based Forecasting – Executive Summary**

Architecture note: This document is deliberately generalized for external sharing. Names, timelines, costs, vendor technologies/configurations, governance specifics, and operational cadences have been removed or abstracted. Content represents options and concepts for discussion — not final; details are to be determined.

The CapEx Forecasting initiative is creating a modern, driver-based model that connects operational activity directly to financial forecasts. Instead of relying on manual spreadsheets or static trends, the model uses real operational data—like drilling and completion schedules and work-in-progress (WIP) updates—to automatically project spending and accruals.

For **Capital (CapEx)** projects, the model combines:
- **Incurred-to-Date (ITD) Costs** from ERP/source systems
- **Accruals** calculated from the latest WIP inputs
- **Outlooks** generated from each business unit's drill and frac schedules

When operations update their schedules, the forecast automatically adjusts, ensuring finance always sees the most current view of project timing and spend.

The initial focus is on **well-level projects** (Drilling & Completions), with future expansion to Facilities and Maintenance categories. The result will be a transparent, audit-ready forecast that links directly to business drivers, improves accuracy, and saves time during monthly close and planning cycles.

Ultimately, this project lays the foundation for a single, connected CapEx forecasting framework across Finance and Operations—tying real activity to financial outcomes in one consistent view.
